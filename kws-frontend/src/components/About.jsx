                We are not an academic group or research lab. Instead, we investigate todayâ€™s 
                ocial issues by combining unconventional perspectives with empirical data, 
                generating radical solutions with real-world relevance. We then test and scale those solutions 
                through a mix of partnerships with academics, nonprofits, government agencies, 
                international organizations, and private corporations.</Text>
